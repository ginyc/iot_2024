Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is an open-source software application that provides a platform for programming and uploading code to Arduino-compatible microcontrollers. Arduino is a popular open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It is commonly used by hobbyists, students, and professionals to create a wide range of electronic projects.
The ESP8266 is a low-cost, Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller chip developed by Espressif Systems. It gained popularity for its affordability, ease of use, and versatility, making it a popular choice for various Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded projects.
The ESP32 is another microcontroller chip developed by Espressif Systems, and it serves as an evolution of the ESP8266. Like its predecessor, the ESP32 is designed for IoT and embedded applications, but it offers several improvements and additional features.
